# Login - Access to the system
The purpose of this page is to help you understand login concepts. As a result of reading this page, you should be able to log into iDempiere.
Navigation in iDempiere is one of the great benefits that it offers since its interface is very
friendly, it allows configuration in multiple languages and when placing the mouse pointer
on each of its icons or buttons, it clearly shows the name and/or role it plays. To enter the
system you may use any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari ...) by entering the URL
provided.

## Login to the system - Authentication

The first step of the login process focuses on authentication (who are you) and language preference.

You have to enter your User name (or EMail in some cases) and a Password. It must be correct including look at capital and small letters.

If you want to select a role you have to tick the box. In the following dialog you can also specify an Organizational unit, Warehouse or a Date for your entries.
To enter iDempiere simply enter the URL assigned in any internet browser,
there you must enter User and Password provided by the administrator of the iDempiere
system. Then select the desired system language from the drop down options.

If you use the GardenWorld demonstration tenant you can use either
the User 
- GardenAdmin with the password = GardenAdmin or
- GardenUser with also the same word as password.

The Role and in some circumstances the Tenant dictate how the system will behave once you are logged in. Chose the [Tenant](vocabulary#tenant) and [Role](vocabulary#role). Let's review the authorization fields and how they impact your session.

### Tenant And Organizations
In iDempiere the tenant is the highest level of an independent business entity.
Each Tenant will have one or more organizations depending on their need.
Each Tenant defines the accounting parameters (accounting schema, tree definition,
among others).
An Organization is an entity under which transactions are recorded on a daily basis

## Menu
In iDempiere, navigating the menu is very simple since it was created as an explorer and
has a tree structure.

To view all options and submenus, you must mark the expand tree option.

The system provides a search box which allows you to filter the options that are part of
the name typed for easy access.
