# System overview

## Some remarks
This guide should help to explore the iDempiere Demo System of the company GardenWorld.
It will focus on the relevant steps to execute simple business. 
Setting up a new company or more detailed options including extensive customization is not 
part of this documentation.

## ERP-Functions in iDempiere
There are a number of important functional areas in iDempiere. Here the main areas 
as they can be found in the menu when you login as GardenAdmin:
- System Admin
- Application Dictionary
- Partner Relations
- Quote-to-Invoice (Sales)
- Requisition-to-Invoice (Purchasing)
- Returns
- Open Items (Financial Movements and Aging)
- Material Management and Pricing
- Project Management
- Performance Analysis and Accounting
- Assets
- Manufacturing 

The first areas **System Admin** and **Application Dictionary** contain many technical aspects.
But you may also find generally important definitions for example the tenant/client or the users. 
Other areas like **Partner Relations**, **Material Management and Pricing** and **Performance Analysis and Accounting**
are crucial to set up necessary master data for iDempiere to work. 
The business is conducted mainly in the functional areas of **Quote-to-Invoice (Sales)**, 
**Requisition-to-Invoice (Purchasing)**, **Returns**, **Open Items (Financial Movements and Aging)** and **Project Management**.
More complex functions like **Assets** or **Manufacturing** will not be part of this guide.

In iDempiere, navigating the menu is very simple since it was created as an explorer and has a tree structure.

To view all options and submenus , you must mark the expand tree option.

Click on it again to shrink the menu to the basic structure.

The system provides a search box which allows you to filter the options that are part of
the name typed for easy access. This is located just before the tree-symbol for access of the menue.

## Outlook

To start a fresh look into iDempiere it is good to explore the menue and then 
take a closer look into main master data from **Business partner** and **Product**
