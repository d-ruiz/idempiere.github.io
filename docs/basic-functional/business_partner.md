# Business Partner

## Introduction
Business Partner is the generic name for all the people/companies with a business
relationship with your tenant/client: that includes, vendors, customers, employes
and so on. Sometimes we need to configure groups, taxes and other specific
properties for invoicing or to manage them properly, so please be sure that you
understand the following capabilities for them

## Creating a Business Partner
The Pharmacy Business Partner window allows you to define any partner with
whom you perform transactions.  
There are different types of Business Partners, these include: Customers, Vendor or
Suppliers, Employees and Sales Representatives each one of these represent a
different role and function within the company.

The first areas **System Admin** and **Application Dictionary** contain many technical aspects.
But you may also find generally important definitions for example the client/tennant or the users. 
Other areas like **Partner Relations**, **Material Management and Pricing** and **Performance Analysis and Accounting**
are crucial to set up necessary master data for iDempiere to work. 
The business is conducted mainly in the functional areas of **Quote-to-Invoice (Sales)**, 
**Requisition-to-Invoice (Purchasing)**, **Returns**, **Open Items (Financial Movements and Aging)** and **Project Management**.
More complex funcitons like **Assets** or **Manufacturing** will not be part of this guide.

## Outlook

Perhaps some remarks on relationships to prices, marketing, services and requests as important relationships for business partner data.
